        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Gustavo Ceballos Miranda. I am excited to share my personal web page with you!</p>
        I have a background in Software Engineering and have been working in some personal projects with Java Spring Boot.
        Some of my key skills include Microservices, Java SpringBoot, and AWS. I am constantly learning and improving my skills to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.
        Outside of work, I enjoy playing pool, playing videogames, and playing basketball. These hobbies help me relax and recharge.
